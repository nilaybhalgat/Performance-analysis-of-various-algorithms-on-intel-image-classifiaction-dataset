The dataset for project is taken for Intel Image Classification project on kaggle.
In this Project, we are classifying images as forest,building.street,sea,mountains,glacier
To use the notebook upload it on kaggle as a kernel.
The size of image used in different algorithms is specified in the kernel and use accordingly.
There are two notebooks one for visualisation of the dataset and other for classification system.
Also a presentation is attached of the results.
The code is not well structured (will edit in coming time)
